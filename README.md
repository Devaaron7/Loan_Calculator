# Loan Borrowing Calculator

Developed by Aaron ( Devaaron7 ) & Kyle ( kyle123c ) 

This is a basic calculator that will show you how much your loan will cost you for the duration you enter.

This requires wxPython Module to display the GUI. 

I've included a archived selfcontained executable version if you don't want to install the module globally.

Here are screenshots of the GUI in use:
